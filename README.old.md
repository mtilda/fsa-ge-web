# Federal Student Aid (FSA) Gainful Employment (GE) - Web

> "Generally, in order to be eligible for funding under the Higher Education Act Title IV student assistance programs, an educational program must lead to a degree at a non-profit or public institution or it must prepare students for "gainful employment in a recognized occupation." Therefore, with very few exceptions, any non-degree program offered by non-profit or public institutions and all educational programs offered at for-profit institutions must lead to gainful employment". - [The U.S. Department of Education's office of Federal Student Aid](https://studentaid.gov/data-center/school/ge#earnings-data)

This React application aims to present FSA gainful employment information, so that it is more accessible to the general public.
